# “WEEDING ROBOT: AUTONOMOUS MACHINE FOR A MORE ECOLOGICAL AND ECONOMICAL WEEDING OF CROPS”

The aim of the project is to design and develop an autonomous weeding robot for more efficient and eco-friendly control of weeds in Indian agriculture. The robot will use computer vision and image processing to detect and classify weeds, then spray pesticides accordingly. It will be powered by rechargeable batteries/engine and will treat up to 10 hectares per day. The proposed system aims to overcome the problems of over-spraying and lack of technology adoption among Indian farmers.

## Aim of project 
👉 To develop 100% autonomous solution powered by rechargeable batteries/engine based to treat up to 10 ha/day.
👉 Detect and classify weeds and spray pesticides according to the way required.  
👉 There is a need for device which is early detection of weed.  
👉 Developing  algorithm  particularly  to  identify  the  weeds  which  are  specific  to  Indian agriculture. 

## Existing System 
👉 Controlling through gesture controlled wireless robot
👉 Over  spraying  the  fertilizers  in  the  farm  land  causing  ecological  imbalance  and reducing the crop yield. 
👉 None of the Indian farmers are making use of technology. They are only predicting through experience on their own. 
👉 When we come with application there is only ‘Plantix’ it has not been trained for Indian Agriculture alliance. It is purely trained only for the US agriculture alliance.
