# “WEEDING ROBOT: AUTONOMOUS MACHINE FOR A MORE ECOLOGICAL AND ECONOMICAL WEEDING OF CROPS”

# Introduction

The aim of the WEEDING ROBOT project is to design and develop an autonomous solution for efficient and eco-friendly weed control in Indian agriculture. The robot uses computer vision and image processing to detect and classify weeds, and then sprays pesticides accordingly. The robot is powered by rechargeable batteries or an engine and is capable of treating up to 10 hectares per day. The proposed system aims to overcome the problems of over-spraying and the lack of technology adoption among Indian farmers.

# Aim

- 👉 To develop a 100% autonomous solution powered by rechargeable batteries or engine
- 👉 To detect and classify weeds and spray pesticides in the required way
- 👉 To provide early detection of weeds in the farm
- 👉 To develop an algorithm specifically for identifying weeds that are specific to Indian agriculture

# Existing System

- 👉 Control through gesture-controlled wireless robots
- 👉 Over-spraying of fertilizers in farmlands, leading to ecological imbalances and reduced crop yield
- 👉 Lack of technology adoption among Indian farmers, who rely solely on their experience for predictions
- 👉 Limited availability of applications, with only 'Plantix' being available, which is trained only for the US agriculture alliance and not for Indian agriculture.

# Conclusion

The WEEDING ROBOT project offers an innovative solution to the problems faced by Indian farmers in controlling weeds effectively and sustainably. By using cutting-edge technology and an algorithm specifically tailored to Indian agriculture, the project has the potential to revolutionize weed control and improve the livelihoods of Indian farmers.
